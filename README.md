# Habit 21

Habit Tracker helps you learn the most effective process, increase self-awareness and set priorities so achieving your goals is easier than ever. It is a tool that enables you to build good habits by tracking them.
Habits shape your life!
40 percent of your actions are not conscious decisions but habits. So habits are a big part of your life - and a lot of the time you don’t even notice it!

Interesting facts about Habits
* Your life is to a large extent the sum of all your habits – good or bad.
* You can take control of your life by changing your habits.
* Habits never truly disappear. They are just overpowered by other habits.
